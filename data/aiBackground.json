  "en": "You are reporting on the 2025 Northern California wildfires. Lightning sparked multiple fires, strong winds pushed the firelines toward the coast, and air quality deteriorated rapidly. Social media spread a \"chemical warehouse explosion\" rumor, but officials have not confirmed it. Official briefings and on-the-ground accounts diverge on some details, and data is changing over time. Under time pressure, you must verify facts, balance official data with observations, and avoid amplifying unverified claims. Your goal is to help readers understand the fire, risks, response efforts, and public impact while clearly stating what remains unconfirmed."
