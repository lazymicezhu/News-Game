# Introduction

Newsgames integrate news narratives with game mechanics, placing audiences inside news events through interactive experiences and potentially enhancing immersion, empathy, and engagement. Prior studies show newsgames help audiences understand causal relationships and may influence perceptions of news credibility.

Generative AI is increasingly used in journalism to automate production and personalize content, though concerns exist regarding credibility and trust. Audiences sometimes rate identical content lower when labeled as AI-generated.

Despite parallel developments, no empirical study has examined the combined effects of AI and newsgames on credibility and emotional responses. Addressing this gap reflects broader questions about journalism in the digital era.

Three news topics were chosen for emotional resonance and global relevance:

1. The 2025 California wildfires
2. Protests by Amazonian indigenous peoples in Peru
3. Nepal’s abolitionist movement against child marriage

# Methods

## Experimental Design

A 2×2 between-subjects randomized experiment will be conducted using the “2025 California Wildfires” topic. Approximately 40 participants aged 18–35 will be recruited. Participants must have no prior knowledge of the specific wildfire scenario.

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups:

| Group | Format    | Authorship |
| ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| G1    | Text news | Human      |
| G2    | Text news | AI         |
| G3    | Newsgame  | Human      |
| G4    | Newsgame  | AI         |

Text conditions are matched for length and factual content. Newsgames are implemented in Twine, sharing identical narrative structures and decision points but differing in writing style.

# Procedure

## Pre-test

Participants complete:

* Demographics
* News consumption habits
* Baseline emotional state (short PANAS)
* General trust in AI-generated content

## Stimulus Exposure

* Text: ~2–3 minutes
* Game: ~5–7 minutes

## Post-test Measures

### Perceived Credibility

5-point Likert scale measuring:

* Accuracy
* Impartiality
* Trustworthiness
* Depth

### Emotional Response

Participants rate intensity of:

* Anger
* Concern
* Sadness
* Hope

### Engagement and Immersion

Measures:

* Cognitive engagement
* Emotional involvement
* Behavioral intention

### Manipulation Check

Perceived authorship: human, AI, or unsure.

### Qualitative Feedback

Open-ended questions on:

* Credibility judgments
* Memorable moments
* Perceived advantages/disadvantages of the game format

# Data Analysis

Quantitative data will be analyzed using two-way ANOVA to examine main and interaction effects of authorship and format on credibility and emotional response.

Qualitative responses will be thematically analyzed using NVivo or manual coding.

---

# Discussion

This study examines how news format (text vs game) and authorship (human vs AI) influence perceptions of credibility and emotional intensity, and whether combining AI with newsgames strengthens or weakens these effects.

Game formats are expected to heighten emotional response. AI-generated news may reduce perceived credibility, though effects may vary depending on labeling and content quality.

The study contributes to understanding trust, engagement, and technological mediation in digital journalism. Results offer practical insights for news organizations adopting AI and gamified storytelling formats.
